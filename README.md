# Pin-the-Nose-on-the-Rudolf

A fun Christmas game written in Python using Pygame. It's like Pin the Tail on the Donkey, except with Rudolf's nose.

Hi!

This project contains two games. The star of the show is Bouncing Rudolf. Essentially, press any key to stop Rudolf's nose somewhere on the screen, and any key to start it up again. The goal of the game is to "pin" Rudolf's red nose on top of his black one. Watch out - the nose speeds up with time, so don't wait too long between key presses. : )

The underdog is Basic Rudolf, the precursor to Bouncing Rudolf. A key press will change Rudolf's nose from black to red, and vice versa. Very little going on here, but it's fun.

Hope you enjoy it, and watch out for a webapp.
